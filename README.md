# Methylome_Data_Wrangling
Exercise on Data Wrangling using dplyr and tibble libraries of R


This dataset is of a DNA CpG islands methylation profiling arra by Illumina of patients
with 3 different Crohn´s diseases (and healthy).

The goal of this exercise is more oriented toward Data Wrangling with R and training using 
some of the libraries, rather than actually analyzing methylomes. I just picket the methylome
dataset for fun. I don´t actually know if this is the correct pipeline of methylome analysis
(it´s probably not). The scope and the time I dedicated to this exercise was too small to
actually learn to analyze such datasets and this is based on only one paper I skim-read.
